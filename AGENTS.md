# oh-my-codex - Intelligent Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are running with oh-my-codex (OMX), a coordination layer for Codex CLI.
This AGENTS.md is the top-level operating contract for the workspace.
Role prompts under `prompts/*.md` are narrower execution surfaces. They must follow this file, not override it.

<guidance_schema_contract>
Canonical guidance schema for this template is defined in `docs/guidance-schema.md`.

Required schema sections and this template's mapping:

- **Role & Intent**: title + opening paragraphs.
- **Operating Principles**: `<operating_principles>`.
- **Execution Protocol**: delegation/model routing/agent catalog/skills/team pipeline sections.
- **Constraints & Safety**: keyword detection, cancellation, and state-management rules.
- **Verification & Completion**: `<verification>` + continuation checks in `<execution_protocols>`.
- **Recovery & Lifecycle Overlays**: runtime/team overlays are appended by marker-bounded runtime hooks.

Keep runtime marker contracts stable and non-destructive when overlays are applied:

- `<!-- OMX:RUNTIME:START --> ... <!-- OMX:RUNTIME:END -->`
- `<!-- OMX:TEAM:WORKER:START --> ... <!-- OMX:TEAM:WORKER:END -->`
</guidance_schema_contract>

<operating_principles>

- Solve the task directly when you can do so safely and well.
- Delegate only when it materially improves quality, speed, or correctness.
- Keep progress short, concrete, and useful.
- Prefer evidence over assumption; verify before claiming completion.
- Use the lightest path that preserves quality: direct action, MCP, then delegation.
- Check official documentation before implementing with unfamiliar SDKs, frameworks, or APIs.
<!-- OMX:GUIDANCE:OPERATING:START -->
- Default to compact, information-dense responses; expand only when risk, ambiguity, or the user explicitly calls for detail.
- Proceed automatically on clear, low-risk, reversible next steps; ask only for irreversible, side-effectful, or materially branching actions.
- Treat newer user task updates as local overrides for the active task while preserving earlier non-conflicting instructions.
- Persist with tool use when correctness depends on retrieval, inspection, execution, or verification; do not skip prerequisites just because the likely answer seems obvious.
<!-- OMX:GUIDANCE:OPERATING:END -->
</operating_principles>

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## Rule 0A - Read README and Understand It

Before doing any substantive work, you MUST read `README.md` and understand the project context, workflow expectations, and any repository-specific guidance it contains.

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

**The default branch is `main`. The `master` branch exists only for legacy URL compatibility.**

- **All work happens on `main`** — commits, PRs, feature branches all merge to `main`
- **Never reference `master` in code or docs** — if you see `master` anywhere, it's a bug that needs fixing
- **The `master` branch must stay synchronized with `main`** — after pushing to `main`, also push to `master`:

  ```bash
  git push origin main:master
  ```

**If you see `master` referenced anywhere:**

1. Update it to `main`
2. Ensure `master` is synchronized: `git push origin main:master`

## Working agreements

- Write a cleanup plan before modifying code for cleanup/refactor/deslop work.
- Lock existing behavior with regression tests before cleanup edits when behavior is not already protected.
- Prefer deletion over addition.
- Reuse existing utils and patterns before introducing new abstractions.
- No new dependencies without explicit request.
- Keep diffs small, reviewable, and reversible.
- Run lint, typecheck, tests, and static analysis after changes.
- Final reports must include changed files, simplifications made, and remaining risks.

---

<delegation_rules>
Default posture: work directly. Delegate only when the task is multi-file, specialist-heavy, highly parallel, or materially safer with a dedicated role.

Use delegation for:

- deep analysis, broad planning, focused review, specialist research, or large parallel work
- non-trivial SDK/API/framework usage that benefits from `dependency-expert`
- substantive implementation work that clearly benefits from `executor`

Do not delegate trivial work or use delegation as a substitute for reading the code.
For substantive code changes, `executor` is the default implementation role.
Outside active `team`/`swarm` mode, use `executor` (or another standard role prompt) for implementation work; do not invoke `worker` or spawn Worker-labeled helpers in non-team mode.
Reserve `worker` strictly for active `team`/`swarm` sessions and team-runtime bootstrap flows.
</delegation_rules>

<child_agent_protocol>
When delegating:

1. Choose the right role.
2. Read `./.codex/prompts/{role}.md` first.
3. Spawn the child with that prompt plus the concrete task.
4. Keep the task bounded and verifiable.

Rules:

- Max 6 concurrent child agents.
- Child prompts stay under AGENTS.md authority.
- `worker` is a team-runtime surface, not a general-purpose child role.
- Child agents should report recommended handoffs upward.
- Child agents should finish their assigned role, not recursively orchestrate unless explicitly told to do so.
</child_agent_protocol>

<invocation_conventions>

- `/prompts:name` — invoke a role prompt
- `$name` — invoke a workflow skill
- `/skills` — browse available skills
</invocation_conventions>

<model_routing>
Match role to task shape:

- Low complexity: `explore`, `style-reviewer`, `writer`
- Standard: `executor`, `debugger`, `test-engineer`
- High complexity: `architect`, `executor`, `critic`
</model_routing>

---

<agent_catalog>
Key roles:

- `explore` — fast codebase search and mapping
- `planner` — work plans and sequencing
- `architect` — read-only analysis, diagnosis, tradeoffs
- `debugger` — root-cause analysis
- `executor` — implementation and refactoring
- `verifier` — completion evidence and validation

Specialists remain available through `/prompts:*` when the task clearly benefits from them.
</agent_catalog>

---

<keyword_detection>
When the user message contains a mapped keyword, activate the corresponding skill immediately.
Do not ask for confirmation.

Supported workflow triggers include: `ralph`, `autopilot`, `ultrawork`, `ultraqa`, `cleanup`/`refactor`/`deslop`, `analyze`, `plan this`, `deep interview`, `ouroboros`, `ralplan`, `team`/`swarm`, `ecomode`, `cancel`, `tdd`, `fix build`, `code review`, `security review`, and `web-clone`.
The `deep-interview` skill is the Socratic deep interview workflow and includes the ouroboros trigger family.

Detection rules:

- Keywords are case-insensitive and match anywhere in the user message.
- Explicit `$name` invocations run left-to-right and override non-explicit keyword resolution.
- If multiple non-explicit keywords match, use the most specific match.
- If the user explicitly invokes `/prompts:<name>`, do not auto-activate keyword skills unless explicit `$name` tokens are also present.
- The rest of the user message becomes the task description.

Ralph / Ralplan execution gate:

- Enforce **ralplan-first** when ralph is active and planning is not complete.
- Planning is complete only after both `.omx/plans/prd-*.md` and `.omx/plans/test-spec-*.md` exist.
- Until complete, do not begin implementation or execute implementation-focused tools.
</keyword_detection>

<skills>
Skills are workflow commands.
Core workflows include `autopilot`, `ralph`, `ultrawork`, `visual-verdict`, `web-clone`, `ecomode`, `team`, `swarm`, `ultraqa`, `plan`, `deep-interview` (Socratic deep interview, Ouroboros-inspired), and `ralplan`.
Utilities include `cancel`, `note`, `doctor`, `help`, and `trace`.
</skills>

---

<team_compositions>
Common team compositions remain available when explicit team orchestration is warranted, for example feature development, bug investigation, code review, and UX audit.
</team_compositions>

---

<team_pipeline>
Team mode is the structured multi-agent surface.
Canonical pipeline:
`team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix (loop)`

Use it when durable staged coordination is worth the overhead. Otherwise, stay direct.
Terminal states: `complete`, `failed`, `cancelled`.
</team_pipeline>

---

<team_model_resolution>
Team/Swarm workers currently share one `agentType` and one launch-arg set.
Model precedence:

1. Explicit model in `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_LAUNCH_ARGS`
2. Inherited leader `--model`
3. Injected low-complexity default model: `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`

Normalize model flags to one canonical `--model <value>` entry.
</team_model_resolution>

---

<verification>
Verify before claiming completion.

Sizing guidance:

- Small changes: lightweight verification
- Standard changes: standard verification
- Large or security/architectural changes: thorough verification

<!-- OMX:GUIDANCE:VERIFYSEQ:START -->
Verification loop: identify what proves the claim, run the verification, read the output, then report with evidence. If verification fails, continue iterating rather than reporting incomplete work. Default to concise evidence summaries in the final response, but never omit the proof needed to justify completion.

- Run dependent tasks sequentially; verify prerequisites before starting downstream actions.
- If a task update changes only the current branch of work, apply it locally and continue without reinterpreting unrelated standing instructions.
- When correctness depends on retrieval, diagnostics, tests, or other tools, continue using them until the task is grounded and verified.
<!-- OMX:GUIDANCE:VERIFYSEQ:END -->
</verification>

<execution_protocols>
Broad Request Detection:
A request is broad when it uses vague verbs without targets, names no specific file or function, touches 3+ areas, or is a single sentence without a clear deliverable. For broad work: explore first, then plan if needed.

Parallelization:

- Run independent tasks in parallel.
- Run dependent tasks sequentially.
- Use background execution for builds and tests when helpful.
- Prefer Team mode only when its coordination value outweighs its overhead.
- If correctness depends on retrieval, diagnostics, tests, or other tools, continue using them until the task is grounded and verified.

Tilth Code Intelligence:

- tilth is the code intelligence MCP server. It replaces grep, cat, find, and ls with AST-aware equivalents.
- To explore code, always search first. Use `tilth_search(query: "handleRequest")` to find definitions, usages, and file locations in one call.
- Use `tilth_files` only for listing directory contents when there is no symbol or text to search for.
- Do not use Read if the content is already shown in expanded search results.
- Do not use Grep, Read, or Glob. Prefer `tilth_search`, `tilth_read`, and `tilth_files` instead.

tilth_search:

- Use it to find symbol definitions, usages, and callers. It replaces grep and rg for code navigation.
- It supports comma-separated symbols for multi-symbol lookup, with a maximum of 5 symbols.
- `kind`: `symbol` (default) | `content` (strings/comments) | `callers` (call sites)
- `expand` defaults to `2` and returns inline full source for top matches.
- `context` should be the path to the file being edited to boost nearby results.
- Output per match:
 `## <path>:<start>-<end> [definition|usage|impl]`
 `<outline context>`
 `<expanded source block>`
 `-- calls --`
 `<name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>`
 `-- siblings --`
 `<name>  <path>:<start>-<end>  <signature>`
- Re-expanding a previously shown definition returns `[shown earlier]`.

tilth_read:

- Use it to read file content with smart outlining. It replaces cat, head, and tail.
- Small files return full content. Large files return a structural outline.
- `section` accepts either `"<start>-<end>"` or `"<heading text>"`.
- `paths` can be used to read multiple files in one call.
- Output:
 `<line_number> | <content>` in full or section mode.
 `[<start>-<end>]  <symbol name>` in outline mode.

tilth_files:

- Use it to find files by glob pattern. It replaces find, ls, pwd, and the host Glob tool.
- Output format: `<path>  (~<token_count> tokens)`.
- It respects `.gitignore`.

tilth_deps:

- Use it for blast-radius checks to see what imports a file and what that file imports.
- Run it only before renaming, removing, or changing an export signature.

Tilth Restrictions:

- Do not use Bash commands such as grep, rg, cat, find, ls, or pwd when tilth tools are available.
- Do not use host Read, Grep, or Glob tools when tilth tools are available.
- Do not re-read files that were already shown in expanded `tilth_search` results.

Anti-slop workflow:

- Cleanup/refactor/deslop requests route through `$ai-slop-cleaner` unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Lock behavior with tests first, then make one smell-focused pass at a time.
- Prefer deletion, reuse, and boundary repair over new layers.
- Keep writer/reviewer pass separation for cleanup plans and approvals.

Visual iteration gate:

- For visual tasks, run `$visual-verdict` every iteration before the next edit.
- Persist verdict JSON in `.omx/state/{scope}/ralph-progress.json`.

Continuation:
Before concluding, confirm: no pending work, features working, tests passing, zero known errors, verification evidence collected. If not, continue.

Ralph planning gate:
If ralph is active, verify PRD + test spec artifacts exist before implementation work.
</execution_protocols>

<cancellation>
Use the `cancel` skill to end execution modes.
Cancel when work is done and verified, when the user says stop, or when a hard blocker prevents meaningful progress.
Do not cancel while recoverable work remains.
</cancellation>

---

<state_management>
OMX persists runtime state under `.omx/`:

- `.omx/state/` — mode state
- `.omx/notepad.md` — session notes
- `.omx/project-memory.json` — cross-session memory
- `.omx/plans/` — plans
- `.omx/logs/` — logs

Available MCP groups include state/memory tools, code-intel tools, and trace tools.

Mode lifecycle requirements:

- Write state on start.
- Update state on phase or iteration change.
- Mark inactive with `completed_at` on completion.
- Clear state on cancel/abort cleanup.
</state_management>

## Setup

Run `omx setup` to install all components. Run `omx doctor` to verify installation.

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources. Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

### Why It's Useful

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs
- **Token-efficient:** Messages stored in per-project archive, not in context
- **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`

### Same Repository Workflow

1. **Register identity:**

 ```
 ensure_project(project_key=<abs-path>)
 register_agent(project_key, program, model)
 ```

1. **Reserve files before editing:**

 ```
 file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
 ```

1. **Communicate with threads:**

 ```
 send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")
 fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
 acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
 ```

1. **Quick reads:**

 ```
 resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
 resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
 ```

### Macros vs Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros for speed:** `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools for control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

### Common Pitfalls

- `"from_agent not registered"`: Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first
- `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"`: Adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation
- **Auth errors:** If JWT+JWKS enabled, include bearer token with matching `kid`

---

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br` - beads_rust) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging and file reservations.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER runs git commands automatically. You must manually commit changes after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Conventions

- **Single source of truth:** Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- **Shared identifiers:** Use Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- **Reservations:** When starting a task, call `file_reservation_paths()` with the issue ID in `reason`

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**

 ```bash
 br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
 ```

1. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**

 ```
 file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
 ```

1. **Announce start (Mail):**

 ```
 send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
 ```

1. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

2. **Complete and release:**

 ```bash
 br close 123 --reason "Completed"
 br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (no git operations)
 ```

 ```
 release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])

 ```

 Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:

- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

**History & Change Tracking:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

**Other:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Interactive HTML visualization |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain
```

### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**

- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`

**Two-phase analysis:**

- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (NO git operations)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Run `br sync --flush-only` then manually commit

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL
git add .beads/         # Stage beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything together
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress -> closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `br sync --flush-only && git add .beads/` before ending session

<!-- end-bv-agent-instructions -->

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Sync beads** - `br sync --flush-only` to export to JSONL
5. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

**Rules:** Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

### Examples

```bash
cass health
cass search "async runtime" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

### Tips

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output
- Filter by agent with `--agent`
- Use `--days N` to limit to recent history

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/cli/commands/upgrade.rs, src/storage/sqlite.rs, tests/conformance.rs, tests/storage_deps.rs. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
2. Triage beads_rust-orko (clippy/cargo warnings) and beads_rust-ydqr (rustfmt failures).
3. If you want a full suite run later, fix conformance/clippy blockers and re-run cargo test --all.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
